# Suraksha — Regulatory Compliance Automation

**AI-powered compliance automation platform for Indian banking.** Upload RBI/SEBI circulars, extract rules with AI, generate measurable action points, route tasks to departments, and auto-verify compliance — all from a single dashboard.

## ✨ Key Features

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **PDF Ingestion** | Upload RBI/SEBI circular PDFs with drag-and-drop. Automatic text extraction and chunking. |
| **AI Rule Extraction** | Claude API (or mock) extracts structured rules with priorities, deadlines, and department assignments. |
| **MAP Generator** | Converts rules into Measurable Action Points (MAPs) with auto-routing to IT Security, Risk Management, or Operations. |
| **Conflict Checker** | Detects contradictions between new and existing regulations (e.g., "2026 circular contradicts 2021 data localization policy"). |
| **Verification Agent** | Reads system logs to auto-verify task completion. Flips status from Pending to Verified/Failed/Partially Done with audit trail. |
| **Impact Predictor** | Visual charts showing estimated effort by department and compliance status breakdown. |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ 
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate mock RBI circular PDF
python generate_mock_pdf.py

# Start the API server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Demo Flow (3-minute walkthrough)

1. **Upload** (30s) — Drag the included `mock_rbi_circular.pdf` from `/backend/samples/` onto the upload screen
2. **AI Extract** (45s) — Click "Extract Rules with AI" to see the LLM analyzing the circular and producing structured MAPs in real time
3. **Dashboard** (45s) — Navigate to the Compliance Dashboard to see tasks assigned to IT Security, Risk Management, and Operations with deadlines and priorities
4. **Conflict Check** (30s) — Observe the AI flagging that the new VAPT rule supersedes the 2022 quarterly schedule, and that data localization contradicts the 2021 overseas storage policy
5. **Verification** (30s) — Click "Run Verification" and watch tasks flip from Pending to Verified as the agent reads mock system logs. Hold on this moment - it's the most visually compelling beat.

## Architecture

```
PDF Upload -> Text Extraction (PyMuPDF) -> AI Analysis (Claude API)
    -> Rule Extraction -> Conflict Detection -> MAP Generation
    -> Department Routing -> Task Dashboard -> Verification Agent
```

# Use "live" for real Claude API
LLM_MODE=mock

# Only needed if LLM_MODE=live
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx

DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./suraksha.db
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

## What Makes Suraksha Different

**The Verification Agent** is the standout differentiator. While other compliance tools stop at task creation, Suraksha goes further:
- Reads actual system logs (mock in prototype, real SIEM/GRC integration in production)
- Auto-verifies whether compliance tasks have been implemented
- Creates an audit trail with timestamps and evidence links
- Flags partially completed or failed implementations
- The Pending → Verified status flip is the single most compelling demo moment
